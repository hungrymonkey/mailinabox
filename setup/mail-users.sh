# User Authentication and Destination Validation
# ----------------------------------------------
#
# This script configures user authentication for Dovecot
# and Postfix (which relies on Dovecot) and destination
# validation by quering a ldap database of mail users.

# ### Sender Validation

# We use Postfix's reject_authenticated_sender_login_mismatch filter to
# prevent intra-domain spoofing by logged in but untrusted users in outbound
# email. In all outbound mail (the sender has authenticated), the MAIL FROM
# address (aka envelope or return path address) must be "owned" by the user
# who authenticated.
#
# sender-login-maps is given a FROM address (%s), which it uses to
# obtain all the users that are permitted to MAIL FROM that address
# (from the docs: "Optional lookup table with the SASL login names
# that own the sender (MAIL FROM) addresses")
# see: http://www.postfix.org/postconf.5.html
#
# With multiple lookup tables specified, the first matching lookup
# ends the search. So, if there is a permitted-senders ldap group,
# alias group memberships are not considered for inclusion that may
# MAIL FROM the FROM address being searched for.

# Rewrite an email address if an alias is present.
#
# Postfix makes multiple queries for each incoming mail. It first
# queries the whole email address, then just the user part in certain
# locally-directed cases (but we don't use this), then just `@`+the
# domain part. The first query that returns something wins. See
# http://www.postfix.org/virtual.5.html.
#
# virtual-alias-maps has precedence over virtual-mailbox-maps, but
# we don't want catch-alls and domain aliases to catch mail for users
# that have been defined on those domains. To fix this, we not only
# query the aliases table but also the users table when resolving
# aliases, i.e. we turn users into aliases from themselves to
# themselves. That means users will match in postfix's first query
# before postfix gets to the third query for catch-alls/domain alises.
#
# If there is both an alias and a user for the same address either
# might be returned by the UNION, so the whole query is wrapped in
# another select that prioritizes the alias definition to preserve
# postfix's preference for aliases for whole email addresses.
#
# Since we might have alias records with an empty destination because
# it might have just permitted_senders, skip any records with an
# empty destination here so that other lower priority rules might match.


#
# This is the ldap version of aliases(5) but for virtual
# addresses. Postfix queries this recursively to determine delivery
# addresses. Aliases may be addresses, domains, and catch-alls.
